## 📝 Description

The Blue Tokai Coffee Roasters project is a clone-based frontend application that simulates a complete coffee shopping experience. From browsing coffee products and viewing new arrivals to managing cart items and navigating through contact or about pages — every aspect is developed with user interaction in mind.

Local JSON files (`products.json`, `brew.json`) are used to mock backend APIs, allowing the site to dynamically render coffee products and brewing guides. This allows the developer to demonstrate asynchronous operations without external API dependencies.

This project also features:
- **Infinite Image Scrolling** for product promotions
- **Audio Background Controls** for an immersive ambiance
- **Animated Loaders and Transitions** to improve UX
- **Responsive Design** for both mobile and desktop
- **Modular Architecture** that ensures component reusability
